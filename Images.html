    <p>This article is all about programming. It is for absolute beginners who are interested in the field.
        <br>Programming is all about giving commands to your computer system to to certain things. There are
        <br>two types of programming languages:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>High-Level Languages</li>
            <li>Low-Level Languages</li>
        </ul>
